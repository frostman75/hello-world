# hello-world
this is my first repository created bro


here to learn github and how to use it. I really want to use this knowledge to lead to a better paying career. I believe AWS is the way I want to accomplish this. I recently decided I did not want to get in IT Auditing. Auditing just sounds boring. I bore myself talking about it. I just wanted to be that because of the possibility of travel. That is NOT a reason to pick a career. I have been struggling recently figuring out what I want to do. I want the job that I have potentially waiting for me in D.C. to come through. I believe that is my life golden ticket. But If that does not come through. Which is entirely possible. I want to learn AWS. I have always been intrigued and I am finally stepping and doing it. So LET'S GO!
